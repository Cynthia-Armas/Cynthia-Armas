### [Structural Change and the Income of Nations](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3855308)

An increase in the supply of skilled labor has been common across the world. However, despite the rise in skilled labor force, not all countries have achieved high income levels, even when their structural transformation follows the same path (from agriculture to industry and, then, from industry to services). Skilled workers might end up in either high or low TFP sectors, according to two opposite theories of structural change (skill-biased structural transformation and stagnant structural transformation). We show that directed technical change is needed to achieve skill-biased structural transformation and, therefore, skilled workers are allocated to high TFP sectors. We present macrodata and microdata evidence to identify the existence of directed technical change. We reveal that in the U.S., South Korea and France, skilled workers have ended up in high TFP sectors due to the existence of directed technical change in the process of structural transformation, but not in Canada. There is a lack of clear evidence for Italy and Spain.

### [Understanding Women: the Preference for the Skilled Non-Market Services](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Uc7fl0NKi8Jk_LK9oMpvgAq6emTsMhMg/view?usp=sharing)

It is a known fact that skilled female participation in labor markets has increased over time but skilled men share is still higher than skilled women share in all economic sectors, except in the Skilled Non-Market Services sector. Why do skilled women end up working mostly in this sector during structural transformation? Our main hypothesis is that specific characteristics of this sector match empowered women's preferences and, then, this phenomenon is explained. Using data from the U.S. Labor Input File and the U.S. ASEC supplement to the CPS we identify three relevant characteristics of this sector: a small gender wage gap, low number of hours to work with a relatively high compensation, and better demographic indicators. A theoretical model that focuses on the preferences of an empowered woman is built. The first relevant characteristic of this sector matches the fact that as gender wage gap increases the fraction of her wage mass devoted to satisfy family consumption decreases in the theoretical model. The largest weight of "own" leisure and family consumption on utility matches the second relevant characteristic. The third characteristic matches the fact that in order for the fraction of her wage mass devoted to satisfy family consumption to increase, she has to work more hours and, then, she faces a high cost: a lower number of children. Then, the trade-off between marriage, having children and participating in the labor market is more favorable for those women in the Skilled Non-Market Services sector since it offers them lower hours to work and a relatively high compensation per hour worked. In order to support these findings a microdata approach is developed. Using data from U.S. ASEC supplement to the CPS the probability to end up working in the Skilled Non-Market Services sector is estimated. Other relevant characteristics that strength skilled women's preferences towards this sector are identified, i.e. a long run stability and job flexibility. Then, skilled women find a balanced trade-off between family and working life in this sector.

### The Role of Intangible Capital in Structural Transformation

This paper provides a theoretical framework for understanding why the High-Tech Industry sector uses less services from other sectors as inputs than the Low-Tech Industry sector.  Specifically, I focus my analysis on the elasticity of substitution between skilled workers and those characteristic services of industry: software and databases capital services, R&D capital services, and other intellectual property products (OIPP) capital services (known as intangible capital). In this chapter, through a theoretical framework I study how the elasticity of substitution between intangibles and skilled workers determines whether a sector is skill-biased. I argue that intangibles and skilled workers are complements in high TFP sectors (High-Tech Industry) while they are substitutes in low TFP sectors (Low-Tech Industry). Then, as investment in intangible capital increases, allocation of skilled workers rises in high TFP sectors.
