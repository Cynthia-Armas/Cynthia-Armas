## Working Papers:

### [Structural Change and the Income of Nations](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3855308)

An increase in the supply of skilled labor has been common across the world. However, despite the rise in skilled labor force, not all countries have achieved high income levels, even when their structural transformation follows the same path (from agriculture to industry and, then, from industry to services). Skilled workers might end up in either high or low TFP sectors, according to two opposite theories of structural change (skill-biased structural transformation and stagnant structural transformation). We show that directed technical change is needed to achieve skill-biased structural transformation and, therefore, skilled workers are allocated to high TFP sectors. We present macrodata and microdata evidence to identify the existence of directed technical change. We reveal that in the U.S., South Korea and France, skilled workers have ended up in high TFP sectors due to the existence of directed technical change in the process of structural transformation, but not in Canada. There is a lack of clear evidence for Italy and Spain.

### Understanding Women: the Preference for the Skilled Non-Market Services

The gender composition of labor markets has changed over time but skilled men share is still higher than skilled women share in all economic sectors, except in the Skilled Non-Market Services sector. Why do skilled women end up working mostly in this sector during structural transformation? We study how empowered women's preferences lead them to be allocated into this sector. Using data from the U.S. Labor Input File we identify relevant characteristics of this sector for skilled women. A small gender wage gap, low number of hours to work with a relatively high compensation and better demographic indicators match skilled women preferences. We then build a theoretical model that focuses on the preferences of an empowered woman. We find that \own" leisure and family consumption account for the largest weight on our empowered woman utility. We also find that as gender wage gap increases the fraction of her wage mass devoted to satisfy family consumption decreases while it increases if she decides to be tertiary educated. This fraction increases when she works more hours, however, it comes together with a high cost: a lower number of children. We conclude that the trade-off between marriage, having children and participating in the labor market is more favorable for those women in the Skilled Non-Market Services sector. In order to support these findings we identify relevant characteristics of this sector through a microdata approach using data from U.S. ASEC supplement to the CPS. We find that the probability to end up working in the Skilled Non-Market Services sector increases if the analyzed individual is a woman, has tertiary education and has children.
